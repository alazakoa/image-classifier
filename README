testOld - 89%
rescored/test both positive and negatives have been rescored

# June 14th  

The new batch are in png form, and they are in the following location

data/newRescored/pngsNeedConvert

The fully sorted and rescored data is here:

	data/newRescored
with the train and test sets in that dir. 

Everything has been fully renamed correctly as in everything in a pos directory is n1,
 and everything in a neg is n0.

* convert pngs add them to the full dataset, and then re-run the model. 
You should have now 9K images.

* watch out for any Thumbs.db files, i tried my best to get rid of them but they are leftover files 
from creating a shared folder between Windows and Linux (Windoge likes to create these files for some reason).

# June 15th 

Data is now fully converted over to jpgs in a dir location:
data/newRescored/pngsNeedConvert/raw-data
